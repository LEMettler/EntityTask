'The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering, that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.' 

Some say one can represent everything possibly tangable within an UML diagram. Some even say UML itself can be represented with the right diagram. All we know - many tried. But the ancient legend says only HE can declare its right article. It is even unsure who was first. The Unified Modeling Language. Or HE.

It is estimated that UML is the higest form of energy and at the same time the higest possible concentration of dark matter. Not often but often enough do the witnesses of a near-death experience speak about seeing an unidirectional arrow reaching to them, just as they were leaving our world.
